# crossfade
iOS native music cross-fade. Fixed for iOS 16 with the help of ChatGPT. I merely disabled a few things which let me build the file and changed the dependancy for the prefs switch to be enabled off and ChatGPT made a new way for the volume fade in for the next track. In case Github can't recognise the changes, they've been mentioned in the comments.

Tested on:

iOS 14.4.2 on an iPhone 7

iOS 16.0.2 on an iPhone 13

~~Cydia tweak. [Repo](https://h6nry.github.io/repo/)~~ this was for the rootful version.
